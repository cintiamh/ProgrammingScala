# A Scalable Language

Scala is a scalable language and it runs on the standard Java platform and works with all Java libraries.

## What makes Scala scalable?

Technically, Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a statically typed 
language.

### Scala is object-oriented

In Scala, a function value is an object. Function types are classes that can be inherited by subcalsses.
 
In Scala every value is an object and every operation is a method call.

Scala has traits, which are like interfaces in Java, but they can also have method implementations and 
 even fields.
 
Unlike a class, a trait can add some new fucntionality to an unspecified superclass. This makes traits
more "pluggable" than classes.

### Scala is functional

The idea of functional programming is that functions are first-class values. That means that you can pass
a function as arguments to other functions, return them as results from functions, or store them in 
variables.

The second main idea of functional programming is that the operations of a program should map input values
to output values rather than change data in place. That prevents "side effects".

Functional languages encourage immutable data structures and referentially transparent methods. Scala
gives you a choice to do so.

## Why Scala

### Scala is compatible

Scala was designed for seamless interoperability with Java. Scala programs compile to JVM bytecodes.

### Scala is concise

Scala programs tend to be short because it is less noisy compared to Java.

### Scala is high-level

Scala helps you manage complexity by letting you raise the level of abstraction in the interfaces you
design and use.

### Scala is statically typed

Scala allows you to parameterize types with generics, to combine types using intersections, and to hide 
details of types using abstract types.

Scala's type system addresses nicely two of the usual concerns about static typing: Verbosity is avoided
through type interface, and flexibility is gained through pattern matching and several new ways to write
and compose types. Some of the benefits of static types are: verifiable properties of program abstractions, 
safe refactorings, and better documentation.
